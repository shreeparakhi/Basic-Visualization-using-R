Calculate Skewness, Kurtosis & draw inferences on the following data(dataSet attached)
a.	Cars speed and distance
  Data for speed is almost uniformly distributed. Not much diff in mean and median.It is negatively skewed and having kurtosys value less than 3 so we call it as platykurtic.       However for distance it is posivitely skewed and having kurtosys valure greater than 3 so we call it leptokurtic. 
b.	Top Speed (SP) and Weight (WT)
  Data for SP column is  influenced by outliers value,We are also seeing diff in mean and median values.Data is positively skewed and it is  leptokurtic.However for WT column data   is negatively skewed but having  kurtosys value greater than 3 because of presense of outliers.So we can call it as leptokurtic.
